## API Testing with Postman

All endpoints were tested using Postman to validate authentication, file uploads, access control, and error handling.

To test locally:

1. Start the Spring Boot application.
2. Register a new user via `/api/auth/register`
3. Login via `/api/auth/login` to receive a JWT token
4. Add the token to the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header in Postman
5. Use `form-data` in POST requests to upload photos
